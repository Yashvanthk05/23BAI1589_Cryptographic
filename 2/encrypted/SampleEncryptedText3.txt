KOMMANA SRIRAM walked into the small market and found fresh apples, bread, and cheese. He greeted the vendor politely and asked about the day's best offers. Children played nearby while neighbors chatted about the weather and upcoming events. The sunlight warmed the cobblestones and a gentle breeze carried the scent of baking. Later he bought a book, sat beneath an old oak tree, and read until dusk. Friends joined, bringing tea and laughter. Together they discussed plans for travel, work, and learning. The evening ended with quiet contentment and hopeful promises for tomorrow. They all wished each other safe journeys.
